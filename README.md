# APEX-UI

An animated **autonomous-agent orb + reasoning-graph** interface — the front-end of
[Apex](https://reznikov-engineering.com/apex), released open source.

Tap the orb to cycle its state (idle → thinking → speaking); the reasoning web reacts,
agent nodes orbit the core, and clicking any node opens an overview card. The orb ring,
agent graph and status bar are **hand-written SVG / CSS**; the cyan particle core is a
small `react-three-fiber` scene (skipped under `prefers-reduced-motion`); and the WebGL
shader backdrop + the overview lamp panel are **MIT community components from
[21st.dev](https://21st.dev/community/components)** (see [CREDITS](./CREDITS.md)).

> Built with Next.js 15 + React 19. Runtime deps: `lucide-react` (icons) and
> `three` / `@react-three/fiber` / `@react-three/postprocessing` (the particle core) —
> all MIT-licensed.

## Demo

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

Then `npm run build` for a production build, or deploy to Vercel in one click.

## What's inside

| Piece | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| `ApexOrb` | The golden ring frame, waveform and orbit dots (pure SVG) |
| `ApexCore3D` | The cyan particle core (`react-three-fiber` + bloom) |
| `ApexHeroOrb` | Stacks the SVG ring + the particle core, scaled to fit |
| `ReasoningWeb` | The agent constellation — circuit traces, orbit rings, 18-node roster |
| `OrbStatusBar` | The equalizer + STANDBY cluster along the bottom |
| `ShaderBackground` | Animated WebGL "plasma waves" backdrop (MIT component from 21st.dev — see CREDITS) |
| `ApexWorld` | Composes the above; owns the tap-state cycle and the agent overview cards |
| `ApexOverviewPanel` | Top-left HUD: live clock, weather, and social links |
| `app/api/weather` | Keyless [open-meteo](https://open-meteo.com) proxy for the panel's weather |

## Customise

- **Social links** → edit `TILES` in `components/ApexOverviewPanel.tsx`.
- **Weather** → auto-detects the **visitor's** city on Vercel (geo headers); edit `FALLBACK` in `app/api/weather/route.ts` to change the off-Vercel / localhost default.
- **Agents & copy** → the `ROSTER` and `INFO` maps in `components/ApexWorld.tsx`.
- **Backdrop** → the shader in `components/ShaderBackground.jsx`; its opacity/tint are set where `<ShaderBackground>` is used in `ApexWorld.tsx`.

## Accessibility

The decorative SVG graph is mirrored by a real, keyboard-navigable agent list
(`.visually-hidden`), the orb and every control are focusable, and the whole thing
respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Not included (on purpose)

This repo is the **UI only**. The production Apex page also has a spoken-voice layer and a
"story" narrative — those are personal recordings and private copy, so they are intentionally
left out. The orb stays fully interactive without them.
